# Analysis code for Epigenomic MERFISH
(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.09.035)
The codes include:
1) Probe design for all the libraries
2) Barcode assignment for each loci for all the libraries
3) Spot decoding in individual single cell
4) Spot decoding in embryonic tissue (no single cell)
5) Layer specific quantification
6) Region specific quantification
7) Clustering algorithm by spatial distribution
8) Tissue mosaic generation for all decoded spots in embryonic tissues

All the codes are written in Matlab(2021a). Some MATLAB functions used in the code are from https://github.com/ZhuangLab/MERFISH_analysis.
